# Dataset

## Facial Expression Recognition(FER) 2013 Dataset

The primary dataset employed in this project is the FER2013
dataset[@FER2013], a pivotal resource in the realm of facial emotion
recognition. This dataset was meticulously curated by Pierre-Luc Carrier
and Aaron Courville, constituting a vital element within their ongoing
research endeavor. The FER2013 dataset stands out due to its
comprehensive nature and standardized structure.[^1]

Comprising grayscale images, each measuring $48 \times 48$ pixels, the
FER2013 dataset boasts an impressive total of **32,298** individual
samples. This substantial dataset is a rich source for training and
evaluating emotion recognition models.

Notably, the FER2013 dataset features meticulous image preprocessing. It
ensures that each facial image is automatically aligned, meticulously
centering the face and maintaining a consistent scale. This
preprocessing greatly facilitates the extraction of essential facial
features and enhances the efficiency of training emotion recognition
models.

The FER2013 dataset categorizes emotions into seven distinct classes,
each representing a unique spectrum of emotional expressions. These
emotions encompass:

1.  Angry

2.  Disgust

3.  Fear

4.  Happy

5.  Sad

6.  Surprise

7.  Neutral

## FER+

In 2016 Emad Barsoum et al. in their paper \"Training Deep Networks for
Facial Expression Recognition with Crowd-Sourced Label
Distribution\"[@barsoum2016training] used Crowd-sourcing and 10 taggers
to label each input image of FER2013, and compared four different
approaches to utilizing the multiple labels.[^2]

The dataset contained the original number of samples, the difference was
that emotions mentioned in the previous section in addition to \"Not
Face\" and \"Unknown\" Labels were voted by 10 taggers and the score of
each label had been recorded.

We merged two datasets to create more accurate dataset which it the
intensity of each emotions can be measured by the number of votes each
label had received by the taggers. For the project, Neutral and Angry
labels can be used directly. Based on the scores for each emotion in
FER+ and the ratio two other labels of 'Bored/Tired' and
'Engaged/Focused' can be extracted which the methodology will be
described in the coming sections.

In the year 2016, Emad Barsoum and colleagues, in their paper titled
\"Training Deep Networks for Facial Expression Recognition with
Crowd-Sourced Label Distribution\" [@barsoum2016training], conducted a
pioneering study that leveraged crowd-sourcing and engaged a team of ten
taggers to label each input image within the FER2013 dataset.

This augmented dataset retained the original set of samples, with a
notable enhancement: in addition to the emotions mentioned in the
preceding section, namely \"Not Face\" and \"Unknown,\" each of these
emotions underwent a democratic evaluation by the ten taggers. The
result was a meticulous recording of the score associated with each
labeled emotion.

To enhance the dataset's accuracy, we combined the outcomes of two
distinct datasets. The resulting amalgamation yielded a dataset wherein
the intensity of each emotion could be precisely gauged based on the
number of votes received by each label from the taggers.

Within the context of our project, the \"Neutral\" and \"Angry\" labels
from this enhanced dataset can be directly employed. Moreover, by
considering the scores attributed to each emotion within the FER+
dataset, we can derive two additional labels, specifically
\"Bored/Tired\" and \"Engaged/Focused.\" The subsequent sections will
expound upon the methodology underpinning this extraction process in
greater detail.

# Data Cleaning

## Eliminating Images Labeled as 'Not Face'

In the enhanced dataset, a subset of images was labeled as 'Not Face.'
These images received various scores from the taggers, and their
distribution is as follows:

-   The number of images with a score $NF=10$ is 176.

-   The number of images with a score $NF=4$ is 2.

-   The number of images with a score $NF=2$ is 4.

-   The number of images with a score $NF=1$ is 167.

A visual representation of some images labeled as 'Not Face' by the
taggers can be observed in Fig. [2.1](#fig:nf){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:nf"} .

Given that the total number of images with a non-zero NF score is
relatively small in comparison to the overall dataset size, it was
deemed prudent to remove all images with a non-zero NF score from the
dataset.

<figure id="fig:nf">

## Eliminating Images Labeled as 'Unknown'

A similar curation process must also be applied to images labeled as
'Unknown.' The distribution of 'unknown' scores for these images is
detailed below:

-   number of images with score unknown=8 is 3.

-   number of images with score unknown=7 is 3.

-   number of images with score unknown=6 is 18.

-   number of images with score unknown=5 is 55.

-   number of images with score unknown=4 is 224.

-   number of images with score unknown=3 is 751.

-   number of images with score unknown=2 is 2526.

-   number of images with score unknown=1 is 8220.

<figure id="fig:uk">

<figcaption>Images with "unknown" score of non-zero</figcaption>
</figure>

In view of the substantial number of images with non-zero 'Unknown'
scores, a decision was reached after careful consideration. It was
determined that images with a 'Unknown' score of 5 or greater should be
excluded from the dataset. This action aims to maintain the dataset's
integrity and coherence for subsequent analysis and machine learning
model development.

For a visual representation of the images with non-zero 'unknown'
scores, please refer to Figure [2.2](#fig:uk){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:uk"}, which provides insight into the selection criteria
employed for image removal.

# Labeling

In the context of this project, it is imperative to classify images into
four distinct labels: Anger, Neutral, Bored, and Focused. While the
original dataset inherently includes the emotions Anger and Neutral, it
lacks explicit representations for Bored and Focused emotions. This
chapter elucidates the methodology employed to extract these target
labels from the original emotion scores.

## Anger

The process of labeling an image as 'Angry' based on the emotion scores
is relatively straightforward. An image is labeled as 'Angry' if the
score for anger surpasses the scores of all other emotions, signifying
it as the predominant emotion. However, to account for rare cases where
all emotion scores are equal, an additional criterion is established:
the score for anger must be at least 2, ensuring a minimal threshold for
labeling an image as 'Angry.'

## Neutral

The labeling of an image as 'Neutral' hinges on the emotion scores, with
'Neutral' being assigned if the score for neutrality holds the highest
value among all the emotions.

## Focused

The criteria for labeling an image as 'Focused' were derived from a
comprehensive analysis of facial expressions that convey focus. Notably,
these expressions exhibit a lack of sadness, and the neutrality score
should outweigh the scores of other emotions.

## Bored

The criteria for labeling an image as 'Bored' are rooted in the
observation that when individuals are bored, they typically do not
exhibit happiness. Furthermore, boredom is unaccompanied by fear. In
cases where a person may appear slightly angry, the criterion is that
the level of anger should be lower than the expressed level of sadness
in the facial expression.

+---------+---------------------------------------------+
| Label   | criteria                                    |
+:========+:============================================+
| Anger   | -   Anger score $>$ other emotion's score   |
|         |                                             |
|         | -   Anger score $>$ 2                       |
+---------+---------------------------------------------+
| Neutral | -   Neutral score $>$ other emotion's score |
+---------+---------------------------------------------+
| Focused | -   sadness score $==$ 0                    |
|         |                                             |
|         | -   neutral score $>$ other emotion's score |
+---------+---------------------------------------------+
| Bored   | -   happiness score $==$ 0                  |
|         |                                             |
|         | -   fear score $==$ 0                       |
|         |                                             |
|         | -   anger score $<$ sadness score           |
